# frontend-project

All of us' first project!

We had to make an app that would in some way, shape or form, help fellow boot campers along their software developer learning journey.

We decided to make an app that would compile all the relevant links, be it specific websites used that day, github classroom links or lecture recording organised in each day within each week.
